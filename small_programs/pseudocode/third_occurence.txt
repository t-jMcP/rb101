Casual:
Given a string and a character to search for
Split the string into an array of characters
Create an integer to track occurences of the character
Iterate through each character in the array
  If character quals to the one that's being searched for
    Increase the occurences integer by 1
    If occurences equals 3
      Return current position in the array
Return nil

---

Formal:
START
Given an a string called "string"
SPLIT string into an array called "string_array"
SET iterator = 0
Given a character called "character"
SET occurences = 0
WHILE iterator < length of array
  IF character at space "iterator" == character
    occurences += 1
    IF occurences == 3
      RETURN iterator
 RETURN "nil"
