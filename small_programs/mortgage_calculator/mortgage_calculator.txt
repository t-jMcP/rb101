HIGH LEVEL PSEUDOCODE

CASUAL:
Send a welcome message
While user wants to keep going
  Ask them for their loan amount and store in a variable
    Check that it's a valid number
  Ask them for their APR  and store in a variable
    Check that it's a valid percentage
  Ask them for their loan duration in years and store in a variable
    Check that it's a valid number
  Calculate the monthly payment using the value of the three variables
  Display result to user
  Ask if they want to repeat


FORMAL:
START

PRINT "Welcome to Mortgage Calculator!"
SET continue = true
WHILE continue = true
  loan_valid = false
  WHILE loan_valid = false
    loan_amount = GET "Enter your loan amount in GBP as a whole number (e.g. 100000):"

VALID NUMBER SUBROUTINE
---

CASUAL:
Convert user input to integer, then back to a string
Compare the result to the original string
  If the two are the same, return true
  Otherwise, return false


FORMAL:
START

SET user_input_string = first argument from subprocess invocation
SET integer_conversion = SUBPROCESS "convert_to_integer" (input_string)
SET string_conversion = SUBPROCESS "convert_to_string" (integer_conversion)
IF string_conversion == input_string
  RETURN true
ELSE
  RETURN false

END  

---
VALID PERCENTAGE SUBROUTINE
---

CASUAL:
Remove percentage sign from user input and store what remains in a variable
Check variable is a valid number
  If not, return false
Check that the variable is between 0 and 100
  If so, return true
  Otherwise return false


FORMAL:
START

SET percentage_input = first argument from subprocess invocation
SET number = SUBPROCESS "remove_percentage_sign" (percentage_input)
SET valid = SUBPROCESS "valid_number" (number)
IF valid == false 
  RETURN false
If number > 0
  RETURN true
ELSE
  RETURN false  

END

CALCULATION SUBROUTINE
---

CASUAL:
Convert APR amount to decimal
Convert APR to monthly interest rate
Convert loan duration to years
Apply monthly payment formula
Return result


FORMAL:
START

SET loan_amound = first argument from subprocess invocation

SET APR_percentage = second argument from subprocess invocation
SET APR_number = SUBPROCESS "convert_to_integer" (APR_percentage)
SET APR_decimal = APR_percentage / 100
SET monthly_interest_rate = APR_decimal / 12

SET loan_duration_years = third argument from subprocess invocation
SET loan_duration_months = loan_duration_years * 12

SET monthly_payment = loan_amount * (monthly_interest_rate / (1 - (1 + monthly_interest_rate)**(-loan_duration_months)))
RETURN monthly_payment
